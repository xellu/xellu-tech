        My name is Pavel (known as Xellu on the internet), and I'm a full-stack developer based in Novosibirsk, Russia.
        I grew up in Czechia and have been programming for the past 5+ years, starting with Python in 2019. As an undergraduate
        student at an IT School, I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
